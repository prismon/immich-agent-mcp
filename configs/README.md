# Local Configuration Directory

Place any developer-specific or environment-specific configuration files in this directory (for example `config-josh.yml`). The accompanying `.gitignore` ensures that only this README and the ignore rules land in version control, so secrets never make it into the repository or its history.

To create a configuration, copy `config.yaml.example` and adjust the values you need, then keep the resulting file inside this folder.
