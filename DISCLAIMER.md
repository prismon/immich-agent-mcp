# ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY DISCLAIMER ⚠️

## THIS SOFTWARE IS EXPERIMENTAL AND DANGEROUS

### DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES

## What This Software Is

This is an EXPERIMENTAL project created primarily by AI assistants (Claude, GPT, etc.) as a proof-of-concept to explore whether AI can generate functional MCP (Model Context Protocol) server code.

**This is NOT production-ready software.**

## The Dangers

This software can and likely will:

1. **DESTROY YOUR DATA**
   - Delete all your photos without warning
   - Corrupt your Immich database beyond repair
   - Remove assets permanently with no recovery option
   - Move files to wrong locations
   - Overwrite existing data

2. **BEHAVE UNPREDICTABLY**
   - AI-generated code may contain logical errors
   - Untested edge cases will cause failures
   - Race conditions may corrupt data
   - Memory leaks may crash your system
   - Infinite loops may consume all resources

3. **SECURITY RISKS**
   - May expose your Immich API keys
   - Could create security vulnerabilities
   - May allow unauthorized access to your photos
   - Potential for data exfiltration

4. **ADDITIONAL WARNINGS**
   - Will definitely scare small children
   - May cause existential dread in developers
   - Could make your cat judge you
   - Might summon undefined behavior demons

## Why This Exists

This project is purely experimental to test:
- Whether AI can generate functional Go code for MCP
- How well AI understands the Immich API
- The viability of AI-assisted development

## Safe Usage Guidelines

If you absolutely must run this software:

1. **USE A TEST INSTANCE ONLY**
   - Never connect to your primary Immich server
   - Use throwaway test data only
   - Run in an isolated environment
   - Have backups of everything

2. **ALWAYS USE DRY RUN MODE**
   - Test every operation with dryRun: true first
   - Review what will be changed
   - Assume it will do the wrong thing

3. **MONITOR EVERYTHING**
   - Watch logs continuously
   - Be ready to kill the process
   - Check your data after every operation

4. **EXPECT FAILURE**
   - This will break
   - Data will be lost
   - Things will go wrong
   - You have been warned

## Code Quality

- **90%+ AI-generated** with minimal human review
- **Largely untested** in real-world scenarios
- **No production validation** has been performed
- **Security review**: NONE
- **Professional audit**: NONE
- **Test coverage**: MINIMAL

## If You Want to Help

This project desperately needs:
- Human code review
- Comprehensive testing
- Security auditing
- Error handling improvements
- Safety mechanisms
- Complete rewrite by humans

Pull requests are welcome but MUST include tests.

## Final Warning

**DO NOT USE THIS ON REAL DATA**
**DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION**
**DO NOT TRUST THIS SOFTWARE**
**YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED**
